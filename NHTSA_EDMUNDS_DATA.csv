THE ANGLE IS FOR SAFETY PURPOSES TO INSURE THE PASSENGERS IS SITTING BACK DURING IMPACT. HOWEVER, WHEN USING A REAR FACING CAR SEAT IT IS A PROBLEM. THE INFANT SEAT MUST BE SECURLY FASTENED WITH THE SEAT BELT. DUE TO THE ANGLE, THE SEAT LEANS FORWARD. THIS RESULTS IN THE INFANT HANGING FORWARD. IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE INCLINE,  CONSUMER MUST USE TWO ROLLED BATH TOWELS PLACED UNDER THE SEAT THEN INSATLL THE CAR SEAT. THIS CREATES THE CORRECT ANGLE THE CHILD CAN SIT. ALSO IN AN INFANT CARRIER THE BAR MUST GO BACK. USING THE TOWELS PUSHES THE SEAT BACK WHICH BUTTS IT UP AGAINIST THE FRONT SEAT, AND YOU CANNOT PUSH THE SEAT BACK ANY. WE ALSO TRIED A REGULAR CAR SEAT (NOT AN INFANT CARRIER), AND IT ALSO REQUIRED A ROLLED TOWEL FOR THE RIGHT ADJUSTMENT. MY CONCERN IS THAT IN TIME WITH MOMENT THE TOWELS ALLOWS MOMENT AND THE SEAT WORKS ITS WAY LOOSE. I CONTACTED SATURN AND THEY STATED THEY DO NOT TEST CAR SEATS IN THEIR VEHICLES. THEY SUGGESTED I TRY NUMEROUS CAR SEATS UNTIL I CAN FIND ONE THAT BEST FITS MY VEHICLE. WE HAVE TRIED THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF NEW CAR SEATS. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD. THE INFANT CANNOT HANG FORWARD. NOR SHOULD YOU DRIVE WITH A TOWEL UNDER THE CAR SEAT WHICH ALLOWS LEVERAGE. AN INFANT DOES NOT HAVE THE NECK CONTROL TO LEAN BACK. THEREFORE, CAR SEATS ARE DESIGNED TO ADJUST TO LEAN THE CHILD BACK. EVEN WITH THIS ADJUSTMENT, THE ANGLE IN THE SEATS RESULTS IN THE INFANT FLOPPING FORWARD.  *AK	IVOQ	N	19981101	Y	N	Y		FWD		GS																V			NHTSA

THERE IS NO AFTERMARKET UNIT AVAILABLE AND THE OEM PART IS PLASTIC JUNK THAT ONLY LASTS A FEW CYCLES TO FAILURE.  THE DEALER SAYS THIS IS NOT A HAZARD SINCE THE WINDOWS WILL PROBABLY NOT WORK IN AN ACCIDENT SINCE THEY ARE POWERED OFF THE BATTERY.  MY POSITION IS THAT THE WINDOWS NEED TO WORK AS DESIGNED AND A MANUFACTURING DESIGN DEFICIENCY SHOULD NOT BE CAUSE FOR AN OCCUPANT TO BE TRAPPED IN A THE CAR.  *AK	IVOQ	N	19930701	Y	N	Y		FWD	F	GS																V			NHTSA

THE CAR HAD UNUSUAL, UNCONTROLLABLE, AND VERY DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR WITHOUT ANY WARNING.   THIS SITUATION WAS SO BAD THAT IT ALMOST COLLIDED WITH A FEW OTHER CARS AT VERY HIGH SPEEDS.EVENTS:(1) WHILE ENTERING HIGHWAY RAMP, GRADUALLY ACCELERATING (WITH SPEED AROUND 30 TO 35 MPH), THE ENGINE HESITATES.     ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, THE ENGINE SUDDENLY ROARED AND ACCELERATED BY ITSELF WITH THE CAR QUICKLY GAINED SPEED ABOVE 55MPH - WITHOUT APPLYING ANY GAS PADDLE.   NO CRUISE CONTROL WAS USED OR TURNED ON.   THE DRIVER TRIED TO APPLY SERVICE-BRAKE BUT THE BRAKE WAS VERY STIFF WITHOUT ANY RESPONSE EVEN WITH EXTRA EFFORT.   THE DRIVER NOTICED THE ENGINE WAS AT 6000RPM.(2) THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY TRIED TO SHIFT THE GEAR TO NEUTRAL.   THOUGH THE SHIFT-LEVER-POSITION DID ENTER THE "NEUTRAL" INDICATION, THE TRANSMISSION MECHANISM STILL STAYED AT THE "DRIVE" AND THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE AND GAINING SPEED.   (THE DRIVER CONTINUED TO USE SERVICE-BRAKE ALL THE TIME TO NO AVAIL.)(3) THE DRIVER TRIED TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN BY SHIFTING TO A LOWER GEAR ("2"), THE CAR SPEED SLOWED DOWN VERY GRADUALLY.   AT THAT TIME, THE DRIVER APPLIED EMERGENCY HAND-BRAKE.(4) EVENTUALLY THE CAR STOPPED USING THE HAND-BRAKE.   RIGHT AFTER THIS, THE DRIVER SHIFTED THE LEVER TO "PARK" THEN THE ENGINE SUDDENLY (AND IMMEDIATELY) SHOT UP TO 6000RPM AGAIN - AND THE TRANSMISSION APPEARED TO RE-ENGAGE AND MOVED THE CAR FORWARD  WITH A VERY LOUD NOISE.   THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY TURNED-OFF THE IGNITION TO STOP THE CAR.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO A NISSAN DEALER.  *AK	IVOQ	N	19970901	Y	Y	Y		4WD	F	GS																V			NHTSA

THE BRAKES HAD TO BE COMPLETELY REPLACED 3 DAYS AFTER WE BOUGHT THE CAR--SIGNATURE FORD CLAIMED IT WAS ARE FAULT AFTER SOME ARGUMENT THEY FINALLY REIMBURSED US FOR THE BRAKES.  WE DISCOVERED A SMALL LEAK, WE FOUND IT TO BE COMING FROM THE HEATER HOSE.  WE DECIDED TO TRUST SIGNATURE FORD, THEY CLAIMED THAT WE NEEDED A NEW HEATER HOSE, WATER PUMP AND RADIATOR.  WE TOOK ARE CAR BACK TO THE FIRST MECHANIC WHO LOOKED AT IT AND HE SWORE THAT THOSE THINGS WERE NOT LEAKING WHEN THEY LEFT HIS SHOP, NO PROOF THOUGH SO WE HAVEN'T FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST SIGNATURE FORD.  WE HAVE SINCE REPLACED THE HEATER HOSE AND WATER PUMP.  WE ARE TAKING THE RADIATOR IN TO BE CHECKED OUT VERY SOON.  WE HAD THE STARTER REPLACED AT SIGNATURE FORD, SINCE IT WAS FIXED THE KEYLESS ENTRY STOPPED WORKING.  WE'VE HAD THE BRAKES COMPLELY FIXED, THREE TIMES.  WE HAVE HAD THE OXYGEN SENSORS REPLACED.  THE AIRCONDITIONER WILL NOT WORK, WE WERE TOLD THAT WE NEED  A NEW COMPRESSOR AND CLUTCH.  THERE IS A SHORT THAT CAUSES A FUSE TO BLOW, RESULITING IN LOSS OF GAUGES.  ONE OF THE BACK WINDOWS WILL NOT WORK.  THE MOLDING AROUND SAID WINDOW DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY.  THE POWER STEERING MAKES A STRANGE NOISE AND SOMETIMES DOES NOT SEEM TO BE WORKING; WE TOOK IT IN TO SIGNATURE WHILE UNDER WARRANTY AND WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS FINE.  WHEN WE FIRST PURCHASED THE CAR THE TIRES THAT WERE ON IT WERE TOO BIG RESULTING IN EXCESSIVE WEAR.  THE CURRENT TIRES SHOW SIGNS OF EXCESSIVE WEAR ON THE INSIDE FRONT PASSANGER TIRE.  THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN TOTALLY REBUILT, THE TECH. WHO FIXED IT SAID THAT THIS IS TYPICAL OF SHO'S.  THE FOG LIGHTS SOMETIMES FAIL.  THE LAMP OUT LIGHT COMES ON EVEN WHEN NO LAMP IS OUT.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON SOMETIMES DURING ACCELERATION.  THE DOOR AJAR LIGHT COMES ON AND GOES OFF AT VARIOUS TIMES.  IF WE HAD KNOWN THEN WHAT WE KNOW NOW WE NEVER WOULD HAVE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE.  WE CANNOT AFFORD ALL OF THESE COSTLY REPAIRS!  *	IVOQ	N	19970801	N	Y	Y		FWD	F	GS	AUTO															V			NHTSA

I NOTICED MY CAR WAS LEAKING LAST WEEK SOMETIME, AND DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS COMING FROM TEH HEAD GASKET. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT SO MANY OF TEH DODGE NEONS ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM IF DODGE MADE A GOOD PRODUCT. IF THEY KNOW THAT ALL OF THESE CARS ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND THERE IS RUMOR OF A SECRET WARRANTY OUT THERE IF YOU RAISE ENOUGH FUSS, DOESN'T IT SEEM FAIR, AND LAWFUL THAT CHRYSLER SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL ON THE CARS AND FIX TEH HEAD GASKETS ON THEIR PRODUCTS BEFORE FURTHER TROUBLE IS CAUSED. IF I WAS OBLIVIOUS TO TEH LEAK COULDN'T I HAVE CAUSED FURTHER DAMAGE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED HAD CHRYSLER NOT CUT CORNERS AND MADE A CHEAP GASKET TO BEGIN WITH? IS IT MY FAULT THAT WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR I WAS NOT INFORMED THAT EVENTUALLY I WOULD HAVE TO SPEND CLOSE TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIX MY CAR BECAUSE CHRYSLER DIDN'T FEEL LIKE MAKING A STRONG HEAD GASKET, AND WANTED TO SAVE A LITTLE MONEY. I FEEL AS IF I AM BEING SCREWED HERE, AND I FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE REIMBURSED. HOW MANY PEOPLE MUST COMPLAIN BEFORE CHRYSLER ISSUSES A RECALL. A RECALL THAT IS OBVIOUSLY NECESSARY.  *AK	IVOQ	N	19971201	N	Y	N		FWD	F	GS		0														V			NHTSA
